##AboutThisApp

    This project was created through the Udacity nanodegree program and is similar to Goodread's basic functionality. We were given some starter code in order to pull the titles from the backend. The point was to create the movement between shelves, and have consistency between shelves and drop-down menus. We also had to create the search page in it's entirety. 
	
    Using primarily JavaScript and the React library (primarily stateless functional components and state changes) this app creates shelving and book components. 

	The user can search for their favorite books and authors to add to the shelves and 
	move books around between shelves.
    
    I attempted to create a "Did not finish" shelf in case someone starts a book and decides to put it down. However, after much trial and error I reached out to the Udacity team and there was somethin on the backend that prevented us from creating custom shelves.
